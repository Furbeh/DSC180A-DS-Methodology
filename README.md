### Lab

Lab hours are for one-on-one help with both domain experts and
methodological experts. 

#### Lab hours for methodology 

Lab hours serve two purposes: help with lecture-HW and guidance with
the code development portion of your domain project. Methodology help
is available anytime on Friday between 9:00-10:50 in B250/B260 in the
CSE Basement.

* Sometimes the lecture HW will *require* you to come to CSE basement
  to complete a portion of the HW. This will be noted on the HW
  assignment.
  
* You are encouraged to come *every week* to discuss and get feedback
  on the code development for the work in your domain project. This
  course depends on self-motivated work and you should take advantage
  of the access to help.
  
* At certain points in the quarter, you will be required to check in
  with course staff in lab to go through a code review of your
  ETL pipeline and replication work.
  
#### Lab hours with domain experts

Unless separately scheduled with domain experts, lab hours are held
Fridays in the CSE Basement (B250 and B260), either from 9:00 - 10:00
or 10:00 - 10:50.

* You are encouraged to come to lab hours for domain specific
  questions as often as possible. Friday lab hours are a perfect time
  to come with questions about the readings or data work that is
  assigned for the following Wednesday. A better understanding of the
  concepts on Friday will pay dividents in productive work on your
  project Sat-Tues.
  
* At various points in the quarter, you will be required to come to
  domain lab hours to check in with your domain expert.

## Assignments

While the course assignments for each domain differ, they all follow a
similar template, included [here](assignment-templates.md).

## Computing Resources

You are welcome to develop your work on your own computer, however
[DataHub](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/) is available for your use as
well. These servers at least as large as your laptop and you can use
them either as Jupyter Servers, as well as via a command-line
interface. As the quarters progress, they may be provisioned for more
memory intensive jobs.
