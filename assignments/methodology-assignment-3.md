# Methodology Assignment 3

## Structuring you Data Science Project

### **Not to be turned in; suggested completion: Feb 03**

* Reorganize your domain project to conform to the project-template
  described in Lecture 03. Use the [example
  project](../week03/project-example) as a guide.
  
* If you have not done so already, create a private github repository
  for your project. You will be turning in the code for assignment-2
  via github (uploading will be turned off).
  
* Create a `.gitignore` file for your repository. As mentioned in
  lecture, the *data should not be versioned by git*. Follow the
  project-example from lecture as a guide, adding other file types as
  necessary (e.g. backups, `.DS_Store` files, `.vs_code`). See [this
  tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)
  for a broad overview.
